------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 1: (2 pts)

The dataset `ChickWeight` contains information about the weights (in grams) of chicks on four different diets over time (measured at 2-day intervals) as the result of an experiment. The first few observations are listed below.

```{r}
# Save dataset as a dataframe
ChickWeight <- as.data.frame(ChickWeight)

# Visualize the first ten rows of the dataset
head(ChickWeight,10)
```

Use some combination of `table()` and `length()` to answer the following questions: 

```{r}
# your code goes below (make sure to edit comment)

```

- How many distinct chicks are there?  
- How many distinct time points?  
- How many distinct diet conditions?  
- How many chicks per diet condition at the beginning of the experiment?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 2: (1 pt)

Using the `ggplot2` package, create a simple scatterplot showing chick `weight` (on the y-axis) depending on `Time`. Label the axes including the units of the variables and give the plot a title. How does chick `weight` change over `Time`?

```{r}
# Load package
library(ggplot2)

# your code goes below (make sure to edit comment)

```

**Your answer goes here. Write sentences in bold.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 3: (2 pts)

Building upon the previous plot, map `Chick` to an aesthetic that assigns a color to each chick’s data points. Add lines that connect each chick’s points together with `geom_line()` (also colored by each chick). Finally, remove the legend. Do all chicks seem to gain weight in the same manner? Why/Why not?

```{r}
# your code goes below (make sure to edit comment)

```

**Your answer goes here. Write sentences in bold.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 4: (1 pt)

Continue modifying the same graph by removing the color from the points only: leave the lines colored by chick, but make all of the points white. Make sure to put the points *on top of* the lines. On which day was the last value of the chicks' weight recorded?

```{r}
# your code goes below (make sure to edit comment)

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 5: (2 pts)

Now, facet this plot by diet. Can you tell from this new plot which diet results in greater weight? Describe how  the relationship between `weight` and `Time` changes, or not, across the different diets.

```{r}
# your code goes below (make sure to edit comment)

```

**Your answer goes here. Write sentences in bold.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 6: (2 pts)

Go back to your plot from question 2 and fit a *linear regression line* (using `method = "lm"` in `geom_smooth()`) to the chicks in each diet with `geom_smooth()`. There should be 4 separate regression lines, one for each diet, each a separate color. Can you see more clearly which diet results in greater weight? Explain.

```{r}
# your code goes below (make sure to edit comment)

```

**Your answer goes here. Write sentences in bold.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 7: (2 pts)

A scatterplot might not be the best way to visualize this data: it calls attention to the relationship between weight and time, but it can be hard to see the differences between diets. A more traditional approach for exploring the effect of diet would be to construct a bar graph representing group means at the end of the experiment.

Index the data in the `ggplot` function to focus on the last `Time` point. *Hint: Refer to Question 4 or find the max `Time`).* Then create a plot using `geom_bar` where each bar's height corresponds to the average chick weight for each of the four diet conditions. Rename the y-axis to include units (e.g., with scale_y_continuous(`name=`...)) and make the major tick marks go from 0 to 300 by 25 (e.g., with scale_y_continuous(`breaks=`...)). Which diet has the highest mean `weight`? 

```{r}
# your code goes below (make sure to edit comment)

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 8: (2 pts)

Building on the previous graph, add error bars showing + or - 1 SE using `geom_errorbar(stat = "summary")`. Make the error-bars skinnier by adding a `width = 0.5` argument. Color the bars (not the error bars, but the bar graph bars) by diet and change from the default color scheme using a `scale_fill_` or a `scale_color_`. Compare the different diets in terms of variation in `weight`.

```{r}
# your code goes below (make sure to edit comment)

```

**Your answer goes here. Write sentences in bold.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 9: (2 pts)

Take your code from question 8 and replace `geom_bar()` with `geom_point()`. Remove the `breaks =` argument from `scale_y_continuous`. Make the points larger and color them all red. Put them *on top of* the error bars. Does the mean chick weight seem to differ based on the diet? *Note: Informally state if they seem to differ and if so, how.*

```{r}
# your code goes below (make sure to edit comment)

```

**Your answer goes here. Write sentences in bold.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 10: (2 pts)

One last graph! And a little less guided... It would be even more meaningful to compare the mean `weight` of each `Diet` over `Time`! Use `geom_point` to represent the mean weight over time and `geom_line` to connect the mean weights per diet. Change the shape of the points to be `x` symbols. *Giving you a hint anyway: color by diet and use some `stat` options in the geoms!* Which diet has a constantly lower mean weight over time?

```{r}
# your code goes below (make sure to edit comment)

```

**Your answer goes here. Write sentences in bold.**
